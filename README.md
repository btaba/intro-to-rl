Hello fellow reinforcement learner! 

I present to you here the solutions to the **coding** questions in Sutton and Barto's Introduction to Reinforcement Learning. Unfortunately I had to take down the previous repo with the written solutions, as per a request from Richard Sutton. I mainly followed the first version of the [textbook here](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book-1st.html). I'm reading the second edition to supplement chapters 8 and beyond.

If you would like solutions to the written solutions, please attempt them yourself and email [Richard Sutton](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/solutions-1st.html) with your attempt. 

Please contact me if you see any errors or would like to contribute to the **coding solutions only** as a learning resource for others. As far as the written solutions, you'll have to try them out yourself!
