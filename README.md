Hello fellow reinforcement learner! 

I present to you here the solutions to the **coding** questions in Sutton and Barto's Introduction to Reinforcement Learning. Unfortunately I had to take down the previous repo with the written solutions, as per a request from Richard Sutton. I mainly followed the first version of the [textbook here](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/the-book.html). I'm reading the second edition to supplement chapters 8 and beyond.

If you would like solutions to the written solutions, please attempt them yourself and email [Richard Sutton](http://webber.physik.uni-freiburg.de/~hon/vorlss02/Literatur/sutton/solutions.html) with your attempt. 

Please contact me if you see any errors or would like to contribute to the **coding solutions only** as a learning resource for others. As far as the written solutions, you'll have to try them out yourself!
