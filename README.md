Solutions to problem sets and code for the older version of [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf), which I can't find online anymore.

I do not guarantee correctness of the solutions presented here, although I always try to get the coding examples to match the graphs exactly as they are in the textbook. I note otherwise when I am unsure of a solution. Please contact me if you see any errors or would like to contribute to the solutions presented here as a learning resource for others.
